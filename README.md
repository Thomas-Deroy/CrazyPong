### 🕹️ The Twist
**Crazy Pong** makes it flashy and way more difficult then the normal pong:
* **Dash Mechanics:** Precision movement to intercept high-speed shots.
* **Power-Ups:** Game-changing abilities that shift the tide of the match.
* **Neon Visuals:** Retro-inspired aesthetics with modern particle effects.

### 🛠️ Technical Breakdown
This project served as a deep dive into **Engine-to-Script architecture**, focusing on decoupling game logic from core systems.

* **Hybrid Architecture:** Developed a custom C++ core for high-performance rendering and physics, with all gameplay logic handled via **Lua**.
* **Engine Bindings:** I fully implemented the C++/Lua bridge, allowing scripts to control entity behavior, collision responses, and VFX triggers.
* **Custom Assets:** Designed all 2D sprites and UI elements to fit a cohesive neon theme.
