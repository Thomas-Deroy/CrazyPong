## 🕹️ The Twist
**Crazy Pong** makes it flashy and way more difficult then the normal pong:
* **Dash Mechanics:** Precision movement to intercept high-speed shots.
* **Power-Ups:** Game-changing abilities that shift the tide of the match.
* **Neon Visuals:** Retro-inspired aesthetics with modern particle effects.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation
This project was developed for a Software Engineering course, focusing on the interface between low-level engine architecture and high-level gameplay scripting.

* **Custom C++ Engine:** Game Engine provided by DAE.
* **Lua-C++ Bindings:** I wrote the bridge between the engine and the script, allowing the C++ core to execute high-level Lua logic.
* **Gameplay Scripting:** 100% of the game logic—including player movement, level triggers, and the "deletion" mechanic—was written by me in Lua.

## 🎨 Art & Assets
I served as the sole technical artist for this project, creating:
* Original 2D icons.
* Visual effects (VFX) for mechanical interactions like the the shake.
